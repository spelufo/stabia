# stabia

Stabia is an editor for the [vesuvius challenge](https://scrollprize.org) scroll scans.


## Notes

- The unit of the world coordinate system is the millimeter.
- The scan occupies the octant with all positive dimensions (3d quadrant).
- Use Vec3f for vectors and positions.


## TODO

- Read about julia's [`:interactive` thread pool](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/multi-threading/). Might be the right thing to use.
