# Compute the medial surface.


# Decompose into 2d parts.
# "For each of the triangleâ€™s edges, if that edge is shared with only one other
# triangle, then the part grows into that neighbour. This growth process proceeds
# recursively until no more triangles can be added to this part. The resulting
# part is a 2D surface. Another boundary triangle is then selected to begin
# another first level part." - Tam 2003
